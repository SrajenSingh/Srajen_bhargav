<h4>
Sri Chaitanya devised a strong Curriculum, integrating the components of Maths, Physics, Chemistry and 
Biology which are needed for the various Entrance Exams under the name of TECHNO CURRICULUM.
The Content Matter is divided into optimum doses so that the students do not feel overburdened with the
syllabus. At the same time care is taken to see that the Components of the Techno Curriculum are strictly according to 
their Normal Course of Study related to the Class in which they are studying at present.
This makes them study their present syllabus in depth with the help of the Micro Level Teaching, providing 
them the chance of improving their performance in the current Class in which they are studying.
