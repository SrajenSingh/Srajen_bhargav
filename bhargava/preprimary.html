<h1 align="center">OUR PRE-PRIMARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM FOCUSES ON THE BASIC FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF EDUCATION.</h1>

<h1><img src="1496053781-06d1877c71-philosophy-icon.png">PHILOSOPHY</h1>
<h3>Every child is a gift of God. As such, it’s the responsibility of everyone to treat them with love and care. Sri Chaitanya believes in the same and follows the Star Kids ideology for its pre-primary wing.</h3>


<h1><img src="605ceeb06d-platform-icon.png">THE RIGHT OUTLOOK</h1>
<h3>Studies have shown that maximum brain development of a child happens in its formative years. The Star Kids approach ensures all aspects of your child’s growth is taken care of with warmth and affection. In an increasingly competitive world, it pays to have even a slight advantage. To cater to this need, we’ve adopted an approach that stimulates the power of thinking and assimilation. The students in response feel enthusiastic about learning and as a consequence move ahead towards success.</h3>
